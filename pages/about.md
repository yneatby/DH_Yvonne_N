## About the Collection

This site represents the quickest collection I could think of for this assignment for two reasons: First, I just finished reading "Secondhand Souls" and had Christopher Moore on my mind, and second, because I have my entire personal library's metadata in Zotero, it was very easy to pull out the data and copy it into the csv file.
After that, I got lost. So very lost. I tried 15 times to include a picture of Moore himself on the cover page, but I could not seem to figure out exactly how to code it. The fact that I have managed to write this about page (if I am indeed successful), is nothing short of miraculous. I would need at least a week with this software to figure it all out, and I do not have a week. I'm still not really sure where Collection Builder ends and GitHub begins. I'm extremely confused as to their relationship.
But enough about me. Christopher Moore is one of the funniest, most delightful writers I have ever encountered, and the only one that makes me literally laugh out loud while reading his books. There are 15 books in this collection, and it does not include another two I've read but do not own, nor the few that still exist that I have not yet read. He's really just terrific. And a little crazy.
